## Overview

Yazi Files integrates Yazi, Helix, Zellij, and Nushell to create an efficient terminal file explorer experience.

### Usage
- Files selected in Yazi open in Helix within a new zellij pane.
- Ratio is set to [0, 4, 0], so 0/4 width for parent, 4/4 width for current, 0/4 width for preview
- This ratio was chosen because in my setup yazi only has 20% of the total width
